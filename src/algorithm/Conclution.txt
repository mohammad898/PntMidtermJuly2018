     Total Execution Time of 1000000 numbers in Quick Sort take: 184 milli sec
     Total Execution Time of 1000000 numbers in Heap Sort take: 174 milli sec
     Total Execution Time of 1000000 numbers in Bucket Sort take: 21 milli sec
	CONCLUSION:

    Bubble sort, Selection sort and Insertin sort are fastest sorting
        algorithm for small sized array and bucket sort is the worst.
   For array with average size, heap sort and quick sort  fastest.
   For array with large data size, bucket sort, heap sort, quick sort and merge sort are the best sorting algorithm.
